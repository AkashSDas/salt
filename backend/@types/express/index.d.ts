/*
 * Extending properties of Request by using Declaration Merging
 * creating an interface with extending Request would work in controller
 * but will give error while working with router, also code can be repeated
 * for just having same properties in Request. So this is a better way
 * Below post has lots of solution, some are out-dated but one used here is working
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37377731/extend-express-request-object-using-typescript
 *
 * To extend Express interfaces properties
 * 1. create folder ${PROJECT_ROOT}/@types/express/index.d.ts
 * 2. Add what's added below in that file
 * 3. in tsconfig.json, add / merge the property such that:
 *     {"compilerOptions": "typeRoots": [ "@types" ] }
