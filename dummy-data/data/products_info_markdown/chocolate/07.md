# **About us**

We only roast the heart of the cacao bean – called the nib – rather than the whole bean. By going straight to the pure heart of the bean, we’re able to produce a more consistent chocolate flavor. We believe the delight is in the details. That’s why we refine the sweetened chocolate to a particle size of just 19 microns, ensuring a creamy texture and velvety melting sensation.
