### **Product Highlights:**

Each FlapJacked Mighty Muffin gives you 20g of protein, with under 20 net carbs and 10g of sugar or less.

Breakfast. Pre-workout. Post-workout. Second breakfast. Leg day. Late night dessert or midnight snack. Mighty Muffin fans eat them around the clock as a tastier alternative to protein bars, shakes or jerky.

Just add water, stir and microwave. Adjust the cook time up or down by a few seconds for a more gooey or cake-like muffin experience.
