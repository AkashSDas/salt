# **About this item**

- MILK YOU CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT: We are the original 100% grass-fed organic milk brand in America. Maple Hill is committed to sustainable practices and the ethical treatment of animals.
- BETTER FOR THE PLANET: Our FSC certified aseptic milk boxes are 100% recyclable, resealable and don't require the use of plastic straws.
- FARM TO CARTON: Milk, the way nature intended from 100% pasture-raised grass-fed cows from small family-owned farms.
- GREENER PASTURES: We use regenerative agriculture farming methods. We grow our own organic grass and our cows graze from pasture to pasture fertilizing as they go. Our closed loop ecosystem greatly reduces CO2.
- INCOMPARABLE QUALITY: Incredible taste, no preservatives. Long lasting and chemical-free, our delicious ultra pasteurized UHT shelf stable milk reduces food waste and can be stored at room temperature for 50+ days after delivery.
