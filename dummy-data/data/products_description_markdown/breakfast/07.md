# **I know, you’re thinking, what the heck, a Texas toast recipe?!**

But hear me out: apparently not everyone knows what Texas toast is. Or how ridiculously easy it is to make. Friends, have you been buying boxes of frozen Texas toast at the store?! **Because this is the easiest Texas toast recipe ever.** Even easier than going to the store, grabbing a box of frozen toast and turning on the oven! This might seem like a strange and overly simple recipe, but that’s only if you’ve never tried this classic combination of fried extra thick cut garlicky bread before.

Texas toast is pure carb pleasure. Golden crisp and buttery, with pillowy soft insides. It’s simply the best. Each bite is amazing: a garlicky crackly crust with soft and buttery insides. So good I could eat a whole loaf and not regret it. When I want to do a carb binge and REALLY live life, it’s there for me. **It’s the perfect accompaniment to barbecue (of course) but it also goes so well with soups, stews, breakfast platters, and even as a snack on its own.**

# **What is Texas toast?**

In Texas everything is bigger, even the toast! At least that’s the rumor on where and how it came to be. Texas toast is really just toast, but sliced twice as thick. It’s usually square (made in a pullman pan) as opposed to the regular cloud-like top most other bread loaves has. It’s a favorite for eating with super saucy barbecue and also for making sandwiches.

# **Texas toast bread vs Texas toast garlic bread**

Texas toast can refer to two things: thick cut sliced bread and garlicky toasted thick cut sliced bread. They sell both kinds at the store: thick cut Texas sliced bread in the bread aisle and frozen Texas garlic toast in the frozen aisle. **This post is about how to make Texas garlic toast**, but if you don’t have access to store bought thick cut toast, you can always [make your own square bread with this recipe.](https://iamafoodblog.com/how-to-make-the-best-japanese-shokupan-milk-bread/)

# **How to make Texas toast**

1. **Make garlic butter.** Melt a bit of butter with oil and stir in garlic power, dried parsley, and salt and freshly ground pepper.
2. **Brush the butter.** Brush both sides of your toast with the butter mix.
3. **Grill.** Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grill the bread until toasty and golden, flipping once. Repeat as needed and enjoy hot!

# **Texas toast ingredients**

- **Butter and oil** – A mix of butter and oil is perfect for this recipe. This toast is going to be pan-fried, so you want the flavor of butter but because butter has a tendency to brown quickly, we’re going to add a bit of oil, which will make the toast extra crisp.
- **Garlic** – I like the simplicity of using garlic powder, which is incredibly garlicky, and has the bonus of mixing into the butter smoothly, but if you want to mince up some fresh garlic, that will take this toast over the top.
- **Parsley** – Dried parsley has come a long way! I keep a bottle in the pantry and add it to the garlic butter for those iconic green flecks. You can also just chop up some fresh parsley if you have it on hand.
- **Salt and pepper** – How much salt depends on if you’re using salted or unsalted butter. Freshly ground black pepper adds a tiny bit of heat, add to taste.

# **Fancy variations**

- **Herbs** – you don’t have to stick with parsley, chop up some fresh herbs (or go with whatever dried ones you have), things like rosemary, thyme, sage, oregano, marjoram, herb sky is the limit!
- **Onion** – add some onion powder to the mix, it’ll make it taste a little like onion rings!
- **Cheese** – add a layer of cheese! Sprinkle on shredded cheese to the pan, it will melt to the toast and create a crunchy frico cheese layer.
- **Spice** – a couple of crushed red chili flakes can spice things up.

# **Texas toast French toast**

Did you buy a whole loaf of Texas thick cut bread? One of the best things to do with it is make french toast, which is fluffier and eggier than ordinary french toast. [You can read more about this extra fluffy french toast here.](https://iamafoodblog.com/french-toast/)
