- In simple terms stock market is a `market where people buy and sell stocks`.
- What are stocks? You may ask… well, an individual stock is a `piece of a company`.
- Stocks are also known as `Shares` and `Equity`, that's why the stock market is also known as the share market and equity market.

> When you buy stocks of a company, you actually buy certain ownership in that company. If the company makes a profit then you'll make some profit or if the company makes a loss then you'll make some loss. Isn't that simple?

**Example**

Let's understand this with an example. You want to start a company and have $10 but you need an additional $10 to start. You go to your friend and ask for $10 in exchange for 50% of your company. Now, whatever profit or loss your company will have in the future 50% of that will be of your friend as he/she owns 50% shares of your company. This is exactly what happens in the stock market but on a larger scale.

## History and Purpose

Around the 1600s, humans were traveling for trade and exploration using ships. This was very expensive, and a single person or company didn't have that much money. So what the traders did was, they asked others to invest in their ships and whatever money or treasure the traders will get from trade and exploration, they will give some share of that to people who have invested in their ships.

But the traveling of ships was very risky at that time, many ships were lost, many of them were looted by the pirates, and so on. So what the investors decided that instead of investing in a particular ship let's invest in multiple ships so there is a chance that at least of them will return home and the investors will make some money.

So this led to open biding on ships in the dock and became somewhat of a stock market that we know today.

## What is Stock Exchange?

Stock Exchange is a place where come to people buy and sell stocks. This place can be physical like the `New York Stock Exchange` or virtual like the `NASDAQ`. But in the general stock exchange can be divided into two types of market, Primary market, and Secondary market.

### Primary Market

The primary market is the place `where companies sell their shares`. It's a company's choice on what should be the price for their shares, but there are some regulations on that. Also, a company can't increase or decrease its share price by much because it also depends on demand, how are people willing to pay for those shares.

**Example**

So if the value of a company is $100 then it can offer 100 of its shares with a price of $1 per share. If demand for those shares is high then the company can sell its shares at a much higher price. So what a company does is that it keeps a minimum price and maximum price and sell their shares in that range.

### How many shares can a company have?

---

Note that `in a company every share has equal value`. So now it depends on that company on what number of shares they want. If a company's value is $100 then it can have 100 shares for $1 per share or 200 shares for $0.5 per share.

A company never sell its 100% shares, the owner keeps the majority of share to have the decision making power in the company. As I said before when you buy shares you buy certain percentage of ownership in that company, so if the company had sold 100% of its shares then those people who bought those shares will become owners of that company and will make decisions. The person who has more than 50% ownership in a company can only take decisions for that company.

### Secondary Market

The secondary market is the place `where people buy and sell stocks among themselves`. Companies have set prices for their shares in the primary market but in the secondary market, they cannot control their share price and therefore the share prices go up and down depending on the demand and supply for shares of a company.

### BSE and NSE

Almost all major countries have their stock exchanges. In India the two most popular stock exchanges are `NSE (Nation Stock Exchange)` and `BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange)`. Her in NSE there are almost 1,600 companies listed while in BSE there are almost 5,000 companies listed.

`BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange)` is the oldest and the fastest stock exchange. It was Asia's first stock exchange. BSE is an ideal choice for beginners or investors who are looking for steady, `low-risk` investments.

`NSE (National Stock Exchange)` is the leading stock exchange and was the first stock exchange that offered a screen-based system for trading. It brought transparency to Indian market trading with a fully integrated business model that provides high-quality data and services. NSE has a high trading volume than other stock exchanges. NSE is a good option for investors who take `high risks`.

## What is an Index?

A stock index is a `measurement of the changes that take place in the stock market`. It `measures price movement and market performance`. For creating an index, one has to group some stocks from the list of stocks with similar characteristics. This grouping of stocks can be on the type of industry, total market capitalization, or the size of the company.

To calculate the value of the stock market index, one can use the values of the underlying group of stocks. Any change in the value of underlying stock also leads to a change in the stock index value. If the price of most of the stocks rises, the index will again rise and vice-versa.

Thus, an index is indicative of changes in the market. It reflects the overall market investing sentiment and price movements. Investors and financial managers use this to measure the value of portfolio holding. They can also use it for comparing the performance with the benchmark index.

### Nifty and Sensex

`Nifty`, also called `NIFTY 50`, is the market index consisting of 50 well-established and financially sound companies listed on NSE. Nifty 50 indices calculation uses the `float-adjusted` and `market capitalization method` where the base value of stocks is 1000, and the base capital is Rs.2.06 trillion.

`Sensex`, also called `BSE 30`, is the market index consisting of 30 well-established and financially sound companies listed on BSE. These stocks are the largest and most actively traded stocks on the BSE. Sensex value calculation uses the `free-float market capitalization method`.

> Some of the standard indices in India are
>
> - A broad-based index like `Nifty 50`, `BSE 100`, `Nifty Next 50`, etc.
> - Market capitalization indices like `BSE Small Cap`, `BSE Mid Cap`, `Nifty Small Cap`, `Nifty Mid Cap`, etc.
> - Sectoral indices like the `Nifty FMCG index`, `Nifty Bank index`, `Nifty IT`, `Nifty Auto`, etc.

## How to sell your company's shares

If a company wants to sell its shares in a stock exchange then it is called as `Public Listing` of that company. If that company is doing this for the first time then it is called as `Initial Public Offering` or `IPO`.

The process of going public is the most expensive option, and it is the most demanding in terms of legal, auditing, and disclosure requirements. But it is generally the best option for raising large amounts of capital and/or maximising the value of a business.

The process of listing of a company is long and complicated to avoid scams. Otherwise anyone can create a fake company and hype it and after that they will raise money and will runaway with that and people who have invested in the hype will lose their money.

To make the system more strong and scam proof there are regulators. `SEBI` stands for `The Securities and Exchange Board of India` is the regulator of the securities and commodity market in India owned by the Government of India. It's main objectives are:

> To safeguard the interest of the investors.Ensure the Indian capital market is transparent to its investors.The capital market function in a systematic manner.

The companies who want to be publicly listed must adhere to specific mandates given by the SEBI. Otherwise, the companies may be not listed or if it is listed and violates SEBI's norms then they will be de-listed.

## How can you buy shares?

To buy shares you need 3 accounts:

> Bank AccountTrading AccountDemat Account

The `bank account` is where you'll have your money, a `trading account` is needed to trade i.e. invest in a company and `demat or dematerialized account` will hold the shares in dematerialized or electronic form.

An individual who wants to apply for shares of an amount less than Rs. 1 lakh is called a `Retail Investor`. A retail investor always needs a broker to buy or sell these stocks, that `broker` can be a bank, third-party apps, or some other platform. These brokers charge a fee known as `brokerage fees (rate)`.

### Trading Account

A trading account is an investment account that `holds securities, cash, and other holdings like any brokerage account`. With a trading account, an investor can buy and sell assets as frequently as they want, that too within the same trading session. Some of the key elements that differentiate a trading account from other investment accounts are the level of trading activity, the purpose of the activity, and the risk involved in the activity. Typically, holders of a trading account are involved in day trading and are often seen exercising long-term buy-and-hold strategies.

For this reason, you need a special account through which you can conduct transactions. This is called the trading account. Without one, you cannot trade in the stock markets. You register for an online trading account with a stockbroker or a firm. Each account comes with a unique trading ID, which is used for conducting transactions. Also, each broker offers different trading account features.

## Difference between Trading and Investment

> Investing takes a long-term approach to the markets and often applies to such purposes as retirement accounts. Trading involves short-term strategies to maximize returns daily, monthly, or quarterly. Investors are more likely to ride out short-term losses, while traders will attempt to make transactions that can help them profit quickly from fluctuating markets. Investors often enhance their profits through compounding or reinvesting any profits and dividends into additional shares of stock.
