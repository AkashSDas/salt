I *love* clotted cream. If you haven’t had it, it’s kind of like a mix between whipped cream and whipped butter, but with a deeper flavor.

It’s thick, it’s creamy, and it’s absolutely dreamy on scones warm from the oven. Clotted cream and scones have always been my favorite part of afternoon tea. I’m obsessed with it. So much so that sometimes, for a treat, Mike and I will go on a little afternoon date to a little British themed teahouse here in town for scones and clotted cream.

I never dreamed that I could make clotted cream, also known as Devonshire cream, at home. They do sell tiny jars of Devonshire cream at fancy stores (like Whole Foods), but save your money friends because those jars of cream are *nothing* like the real thing. Dare I say they’re disgusting? Instead, buy a quart of good quality, organic whipping cream, and make your own, at home!

I didn’t think it was possible, but one day, Mike and I had this lovely little conversation:

**Mike:** You should make clotted cream.**Me:** Dude, I don’t know how to make clotted cream!**Mike:** Baby, I love you, but if we have to go to Secret Garden one more time to feed your clotted cream addiction, I might just go crazy.**Me:** Yeah, I know it’s not really your scene (the scene there is more octogenarian than our normal hangouts)…but they have clotted cream to go! We can just buy it and have it at home?**Mike:** If they can make clotted cream, *you* can make clotted cream.

That got me thinking. It was true! The teahouse here doesn’t source their clotted cream from some mystical clotted cream wholesaler – trust me, I know because I’ve done the google searches. Mike was right! They make their clotted cream in house. So, theoretically, if they could do it, we could do it. Mike did some googling and came across [this recipe](http://www.rockrecipes.com/how-to-make-clotted-cream-for-the-perfect-cream-tea/) (by a Canadian!)

It sounded impossibly easy and too good to be true. Was I really one ingredient and 2 days away from my own unlimited source of clotted cream?! Mike and I immediately went out to find some non-ultra pasteurized cream. I popped it into the oven and the next day, there it was! The top of the cream had solidified into something resembling clotted cream. It just needed a little while in the fridge before it was ready.

It was so incredibly satisfying to scoop off that top layer of chilled cream. I whipped it up to give it some body and had some immediately on toast, with jam and a generous sprinkle of flaky sea salt. It was SO GOOD. Maybe even better that the clotted cream from the teahouse? We did a side by side taste test (yup, Mike and I went to the teahouse one last time to get some takeout clotted cream) and the difference was indiscernible. Mike felt that the store made version was saltier, which makes sense, considering that I didn’t salt ours at all. It was also a touch more whipped. Salt and whip away to your preference, you’re *this* close to homemade clotted cream!

# **What is clotted cream?**

Clotted cream sounds kind of funny, but really, it’s SO delicious. It’s also called Devonshire cream or Cornish cream, so if you’re not so fond of the word “clotted,” you can think of it like that. Really, clotted is just another word for thick, so just think of it as thick cream! Clotted cream is thick, spreadable form of heavy cream first invented way back in the day by dairy farmers in Devon as a way to preserve milk.

# **What does it taste like?**

Clotted cream tastes rich and, well, creamy. It’s not particularly sweet because it’s made from just cream. It’s fairly neutral like whipped cream and is the perfect compliment to jam. It has a smooth, rich texture that just melts in your mouth. It has a very slight hint of sweetness, kind of similar to how a really good butter tastes a bit sweet.

# **What do you eat it with?**

Clotted cream is essential with a batch of scones. Trust me when I say you haven’t lived until you’ve eaten a fresh scone slathered with clotted cream and jam. It’s divine. Clotted cream is standard when you have British tea and scones. You can pretty much also eat it on anything where you would have butter. I love it on toast and I’ve been known to eat it with slices of banana bread too. You can also have a smoosh alongside cake.

# **Clotted cream ingredients**

- **Cream.** All you need to make clotted cream is heavy whipping cream. That’s it! You’ll need to make sure the milk fat percentage is 35% or higher and that it’s not ultra pasteurized and you’ll be good to go.

# **How to make clotted cream**

- **Bake.** Pour your cream into an oven safe dish and bake it in a very low oven for 10 to 12 hours, or overnight.
- **Cool.** Let it cool down to room temp then place the dish in the fridge to firm and chill up.
- **Skim.** The slightly golden, thickened layer of cream at the top of the dish is clotted cream! Skim it off then enjoy.

# **What kind of cream to make clotted cream?**

Clotted cream is made from heavy cream or whipping cream. Heavy cream is the high-fat layer that skimmed off of milk before homogenization. It’s kind of like that saying, “the cream always rises.” Because cream has so much fat in it, it rises to the top of milk and is skimmed off. We’re going to take heavy cream and concentrate it even more. Since you only need one ingredient to make clotted cream, it’s best to use the highest quality cream you can find: local, organic, grass fed. Essentially, you want the stuff that tastes really good because your clotted cream will taste like the cream you buy.

# **What is heavy cream?**

Heavy cream is just another name for whipping cream. It’s also sometimes labeled as heavy whipping cream. As long as the label says 35% fat or higher, you can make clotted cream with it.

# **What is ultra pasteurized heavy cream?**

Ultra pasteurized cream is cream that’s been heated to 280°F so that the cream is more shelf stable. Unfortunately you can’t use ultra pasteurized heavy cream to make clotted cream. I’m not too sure on the science of it but ultra pasteurized heavy cream won’t clot as much as regular pasteurized cream.

# **Can I make clotted cream in an Instant Pot?**

Yes! Just place the heavy cream in your Instant Pot and choose the yogurt setting until it hits boil. When the Instant Pot beeps to let you know that it’s come to temp, press keep warm. Let the cream cook for 8-10 hours. Turn the Instant Pot off and let cool down completely then place the insert in the fridge for at least 12 hours to chill and firm up. Scoop off the top layer of thickened cream – that’s the clotted cream.

# **Slow cooker clotted cream**

Yes, but it depends on your slow cooker settings. You’ll want to add the cream to the slow cooker and keep it on warm – the cream needs to stay between 165-180°F so read your manual to see which setting that is. It should probably just be warm, but it might also be the low setting, so double check. Once your cream is in the slow cooker and the temp is right, cover it with the lid and let cook for 8-10 hours or until a light golden crust starts to form. Turn the slow cooker off and let cool to room temp before chilling in the fridge completely, then skim off the top thickened layer for your clotted cream.

# **Or even a rice cooker?!**

Yup, as lot as your rice cooker has a keep warm setting that keeps things warm from 165-180°F. You can test your rice cooker with water and an instant read thermometer. Just pour 4 cups of water, set it on keep warm and after 30 minutes or so, check the temp of the water. If it reaches 165-180°F, you can make clotted cream in it. Simply pour the cream into the bowl and set the keep warm for 8-10 hours. Double check every so often to make sure your rice cooker hasn’t turned off. When it’s done, let it cool to room temp then pop it in the fridge to cool completely before skimming off the clotted cream that has formed on the top.

# **Why is there a crust on my clotted cream?**

The crust is the part that you want – it’s the cream that has been clotted. Most people skim off the top most layer that is the thickest. Underneath the thickest layer there may be another layer that is a bit more loose. You can skim this out too and use it to loosen your clotted cream if you like a looser, more flowy clotted cream. Underneath that layer will be liquid, which is the leftover whey (the liquid that is left over after making cheese or butter). You can use the whey in baked goods.

# **What can I do with the left over liquid?**

After you skim off the lovely layer of clotted cream, you’ll notice some whey at the bottom of your dish. You can use this in any baked good that calls for milk. You could use it to make scones (perfect for you clotted cream), muffins, and cakes.

toast and clotted cream for everyone!xoxo steph

PS – That last shot is clotted cream with a bit of powdered strawberries and gold flecks!
