I’m sure by now you’ve heard of dalgona coffee, that viral instant coffee drink that’s ALL over right now. This is the matcha version: fluffy, dense, frothy, foamy matcha floating on iced milk. There are three different ways people are making dalgona matcha: with just straight matcha, with egg whites, and with whipping cream. I made dalgona matcha with egg whites and with whipping cream so you can take a look at the difference and decide which way you want to dalgona matcha at home today!

**What is dalgona matcha?**Dalgona matcha is essentially fluffy matcha milk. It’s based off the ever popular dalgona coffee, which uses instant coffee. Instead of coffee, dalgona matcha uses matcha or green tea powder.

**How is it made?**Dalgona matcha is made by whipping either egg whites or cream with matcha powder and sugar until thick and fluffy. The fluffy matcha is then scooped onto iced (or hot) milk.

**Do I have to use egg whites?**Nope, you can use heavy whipping cream if you don’t want to use egg whites.

**Do I have to use heavy whipping cream?**Nope, you can use egg whites if you don’t want to use heavy whipping cream. Otherwise, heavy whipping cream is your best bet. If you’re familiar with whipping up coconut cream you could use that as well.

**Do I have to use sugar?**For the egg white mixture, sugar is best because the sugar will help the meringue keep its structure. If you making the whipped cream version, any sweetener is possible.

**Do I have to use a mixer?**Yes! Unlike dalgona coffee, I don’t recommend making this drink without a mixer because you’re basically making either a meringue or whipped cream and it takes a lot of power to whip egg whites or heavy cream by hand. Either a stand mixer or hand mixer will work.

**Does it have to be iced milk?**You can use hot milk or iced, it’s up to you! I went with iced because it makes the milk go farther and I need to stretch out my milk for as long as possible. Also iced drinks always make me think of long lingering afternoons at cafes so I wanted that cafe feeling at home. But of course, hot matcha lattes are definitely delicious too!

**Does it have to be milk?**You can put your whipped dalgona matcha on anything you want including matcha or other non-dairy milks like oat milk, almond, soy, cashew, etc.

**What does it taste like?**Dalgona matcha tastes like matcha milk but with a thick and creamy airy texture that’s velvety and rich. It’s sweet and has a nice hit of matcha.

**Which dalgona matcha should I make, egg or cream?**That’s up to you! The egg dalgona matcha is more velvety and tastes more luscious on the tongue but the cream dalgona matcha is light yet rich and creamy. I like the texture of the egg but I prefer the taste of the cream. The creamy matcha dalgona is a lot quicker and easier to make too so I like that, but it’s up to you!
