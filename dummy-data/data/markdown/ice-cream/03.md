There’s a very popular ice cream shop here in town that I felt never really lived up to the hype. There would be lines out the door, but the one time I tried something, it was icy and bland. After that I swore, never again. But then, they opened up a second location and Mike and I would walk by almost everyday. One sunny day, when there was magically no line, we popped in to take a look at the flavors. Carrot cake immediately called out to me. I mean, [I love carrot cake](https://iamafoodblog.com/carrot-loaf-recipe/). I had a taste, was sold, and was the happy new owner of a very addictive [waffle cone full of creamy ice cream with fluffy chunks of carrot cake and cream cheese icing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BUAOCqqgdHy/). It was so good that I was sad when it was over.

Because, the truth is, it was over for good. I’ve been back so many times looking for carrot cake, but they never have it!? Mike and I would peek through the windows, not see it on the flavor boards, and just go on with our walk. Finally, we went in to ask when they were going to bring it back.

**Me:** Do you know when you’re going to bring back carrot cake?**Ice Cream Girl:** Oh. Um, unknown.**Me** (with obvious dismay)**:** UNKNOWN!?**Ice Cream Girl:** It was a trial flavor so we don’t know if they’ll every bring it back**Me:** silent tears

Anyway, long story short, this is why I made these carrot cake cream cheese pudding pops. Because I needed to drown my sorrows. And also because it’s popsicle week!

PS – As I was writing this, I just checked their Insta geotag and it looks like they have carrot cake right now!? Unless someone did a latergram? The suspense is killing me. Gotta go, gotta get ice cream!!! Update: they didn’t have the ice cream. *TEARS.*
