EEE!! Sometimes I make something and it turns out just the way I want and I get over the moon giddy about it. These bubble waffle cones/puffle cones/eggloo egg waffle cones were totally just how I wanted them to be. Confession: before this, I’ve never had a puffle cone. I think I’ve had literally thousands of egg waffles – they’re one of my all time favorite Hong Kong style treats – but shaped into a cone and filled with ice cream? Nope. Of course, all the awesome looking puffle cone places are far away – Cauldron Ice Cream in Santa Ana, Eggloo in NYC – so I just had to make some for myself.

Bubble waffles are easy to make, with just one caveat: you need a bubble waffle maker. I’ve had several due to my bubble waffle obsession and I can say, hands down, my favorite is this electric one. The kind that interlock that you use over the stove work well too but it’s a lot harder to maintain the right amount of heat and you have to work a lot more quickly. I imagine the professional twirly ones they use in the streets of Hong Kong would be awesome to use too but I don’t think my home could fit another waffle maker.

Anyway, once you have your bubble waffle maker, it’s just a question of the batter. I went with a hybrid of a classic Hong Kong egg waffle batter and a lightened up waffle batter. Most HK egg waffles don’t have you whip up egg whites but I find that it lends a light and fluffy crispiness to the waffles. The key ingredient, if you want your waffles to taste like the ones you get out is the custard powder. You can find it at most grocery stores (or on Amazon), but it is kind of a weird retro British ingredient. It’s what adds that extra eggy custard-y quality to the waffle. Otherwise it’ll taste just like a regular waffle. A good waffle, but a regular good sweet waffle.

Once you have your waffle iron and batter sorted out, you’ll want something to help you shape your cones. I made little paper cones that worked really well, but you can also just cone them up and put them in a tall glass to help hold their shape too. From there it’s just a question of filling them with your favorite ice cream and toppings. I went with some Strawberry Pocky, sprinkles, and a delicious roll cookie. Super cute, fun, and delicious.

These would be so awesome to make with a bunch of friends on a summer evening. The combinations are endless. Summertime forever!

A note on how long to cook the waffles: if you want them on the softer side, let them just go to golden brown and let them cool naturally in the cone shape. Typically HK egg waffles are a combination of crispy edges and soft and chewy bubbles. If you want more of that texture, make sure to cook the waffles a little longer. Also, after you cook them and they’ve been shaped, cool them rapidly by fanning them with a fan or magazine – it really helps everything crisp up to the right texture and it’s how you see street vendors doing it in Hong Kong.
