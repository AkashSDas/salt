After my [mini cinnamon babka success](https://iamafoodblog.com/small-batch-mini-sourdough-babka/), I decided to make another mini loaf, this time chocolate since chocolate babka is the babka everyone thinks of when they think of babka.

Chocolate babka being known as the popular babka is thanks to Seinfeld by the way. And the chocolate babka that we all know and love on Instagram is thanks to Breads Bakery. After some deep internet googling (because I’m into food history), I discovered that babka as we know it isn’t what babka used to be. Before the loaves of buttery, shiny, twisted strands of syrup soaked brioche with chocolate, babka used to be dry and crumbly. It was made with oil instead of butter and instead of being plush and bread-y, it was dense and according to the internet, not very good.

So what changed then? Well, originally babkas were made with leftover bits of dough twisted with seeds and nuts, kind of as a treat, but not quite a sweet one. Chocolate used to be an expensive luxury item and grandmas (babka means little grandmother) were definitely not using chocolate. It was only when Eastern European Jewish immigrants got to America that they started using chocolate in babkas resulting in the rich and tasty loaves we have today. Still, there’s a bit of a jump from the chocolate babkas of yesterday and the babkas that fill our instagram feeds today.

Babka really took off in popularity in the 2010s after Breads Bakery, helmed by Uri Scheft, a Danish-Israeli pastry chef from Tel Aviv, opened in NYC. Breads became the place to get babka, both traditional chocolate and cinnamon versions as well as specialty ones filled with nutella or za’atar and feta. After that, NYC was crazy for babka and babka started showing up everywhere. Soon after that babka was the thing to bake at home. And now that sourdough is a thing thanks to covid, I’ve been seen sourdough babka everywhere, almost as much as dalgona coffee. Hmm, I wonder if I could marry the two and make dalgona coffee babka…

Anyway, here’s my very mini small batch chocolate babka loaf. It’s based off of The Perfect Loaf’s babka with a slight variation in technique and filling. It made just the tiniest CUTEST babka loaf ever. Tender and plush, buttery and sweet, full of dark chocolate with just the hint of sweetness from the simple syrup glaze. Make one today! Well, start one today and bake it off tomorrow because that’s just the way sourdough goes, isn’t it? ;)

PS – This recipe makes an even SMALLER batch of babka than the small batch mini cinnamon babka. That loaf’s total dough weight equals 377 grams while this loaf comes in at a diminutive 254 grams. I’ve included the baker’s percentages for you so you can scale as needed to fit your loaf pan. I used a mini pullman loaf that holds 2 cups of liquid. The recipe below will work well in a 6×3 inch pan as well.
