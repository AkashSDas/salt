I am deep into baking things without eggs. First, I was all about [dividing eggs up for small batching](https://iamafoodblog.com/spice-up-your-cookie-life-1-egg-4-cookies-small-batch-baking-style/), but now I’m all about [small batch recipes that don’t even use eggs](https://iamafoodblog.com/small-batch-mini-chocolate-loaf-cake-recipe/). The nice thing about egg free cake is that it’s vegan and also perfect for people who happen to be allergic to eggs, like my littlest nephew. Luckily for him, he just grew out of that allergy and he’s so happy about it! The first thing he wanted to eat was cake. He’s not really into eggs themselves, just cake.

But, for all those other people out there who are still allergic to eggs, or are vegan, these baked chocolate doughnuts are for you! They’re really quick to put together: just stir together the dry ingredients, make a well, pour the wet ingredients in the well, mix it up and bake. Essentially this recipe is [this one](https://iamafoodblog.com/chocolate-and-cream-cheese-black-bottom-cupcakes/), but in doughnut form. I went ahead and put some non-vegan cream cheese frosting on it because I’m living my best life but you can keep it vegan with a bit of simple coconut oil and powdered sugar glaze.

Oh, and sprinkles of course! I got these sprinkles at my favorite bulk store. It’s amazing there. Every holiday they have a selection of themed sprinkles. And they have the best snack foods. At first it was a little weird to see bins and bins of things like cheetos, chips, and pretzels, but then I realized the potential: SNACK PARTY! It’s awesome because it’s a bulk store so you can get as much or as little as you like and everything is really fresh because they have incredible turnover. Inevitably when we go, I pick out a tiny amount of every conceivable salty snack. Mike always just gets a big bag of sour candies. When we get home I put all my salty snacks onto different little plates and have a little snack smorgasbord party. SO GOOD.

Also so good are these doughnuts. It’s a good thing that they’re small batch because I just ate two in a row. Soon they’ll be gone and I won’t have to feel too guilty about it because there were only 5.

Happy Valentine’s Day!

PS – Are you a one flavor giant family size bag of chips person or a six different little bags of chips person?
