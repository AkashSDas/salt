# TikTok whipped hot chocolate coming in hot for all those fall feels!

TikTok may be banned soon, but the TikTok food trends are still going strong! If you loved dalgona coffee and whipped matcha, whipped hot chocolate is here for you this fall season.

# **What is whipped hot chocolate?**

Remember [dalgona coffee](https://iamafoodblog.com/how-to-make-fluffy-frothy-whipped-coffee-tips-and-tricks-for-making-dalgona-coffee/)? The super whipped coffee that took over the internet for a little while back at the beginning of quarantine? Whipped hot chocolate is its chocolate-y cousin: deep, dark, mysterious, and ultimately, delicious. It’s cocoa powder that’s been whipped with heavy whipping cream to fluff up into a whipped chocolate topping that you can put on hot or cold milk. Essentially it’s chocolate whipping cream!

# **How to make whipped hot chocolate**

Good news, this is super easy to make. Even easier than dalgona. All you need is: cocoa powder, sugar (or sweetener), and heavy whipping cream.

1. **Mix.** In a bowl or liquid measuring cup, stir together heavy whipping cream, cocoa powder, and sugar. If you like, you can use a small sieve to get the lumps out of your cocoa powder.
2. **Fluff.** Whip the chocolate mixture up using a whisk, hand mixer, or milk frother until it be comes light, fluffy, and thick. You want it to be whipped but pourable.
3. **Pour.** Add your hot or cold milk to a glass or mug.
4. **Top.** Top the milk with the fluffy hot chocolate. Stir and enjoy!

# **Whipped hot chocolate ingredients**

- **Heavy whipping cream:** This is what will make your hot chocolate super fluffy. Sometimes it’s just called whipping cream or heavy cream. Either way, you’ll find it next to the milk. It should have 30-36% milk fat.
- **Cocoa powder:** Ordinary un-sweetened cocoa powder, like what you use in [brownies](https://iamafoodblog.com/super-chocolatey-extra-small-batch-brownies/) or [chocolate mug cake](https://iamafoodblog.com/2-minute-chocolate-mug-cake-recipe/)
- **Sugar or sweetener:** Sweeten to taste using sugar or sweetener of your choice.

# **Do I have to use cocoa powder?**

If you have hot chocolate mix, you can use that, just leave out the sugar!

# **Do I have to use heavy cream?**

Yes, the heavy cream (or whipping cream) is what whips up into the fluffy soft cream.

# **Can I make hot chocolate without sugar?**

Yes! But if you’re using just cocoa powder it won’t taste sweet. You can use sweetener instead, like honey or maple syrup.

# **What kind of milk can I use?**

Any milk is good! I use 2% here. You can substitute your favorite milk: almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, or any milk alternative. It’s the biggest part of the drink so make sure it’s a milk you like!

# **Hot vs cold**

You can use hot milk or iced/cold, it’s up to you! I used warm steamed milk because I wanted that warm and cozy hot chocolate feeling.

# **What does whipped hot chocolate taste like?**

Like heaven! It’s like regular hot chocolate (if you have it hot) but with a velvety smooth and creamy texture. It’s sweet and chocolate-y and the best on a chilly day.

# **The best way to cream**

My favorite way is to use a coffee milk frother. I put everything into a tall liquid measuring cup and whip it in there. Here are some other ways you can whip hot chocolate, from best to worst:

- **Hand Held Frother** – My favorite way to make any whipped drink! [This is the frother I have](https://amzn.to/2E0Stz3) and it works perfectly because it’s very very powerful and it doesn’t take a long time. If you do use a frother, put the mixture in a liquid measuring cup, jar or tall glass instead of a bowl, it’ll make it a tiny bit easier.
- **Hand Held Electric Mixer** – This is probably the next easiest way because you can press your whisks right up against the mixture and you don’t need to use any arm strength.
- **Stand Mixer** – This is hands free but you need to make sure you have enough liquid in the bowl so that the whisks actually touch the mixture. You’ll probably need to do a triple or quadruple batch.
- **Small Whisk or Matcha Whisk** – This is the cheapest way to whip. It works and it works well and you don’t have to get a machine out to do it. It takes some time, but it’s exercise!
- **Jar** – You can put everything in a jar and shake it up. It takes a while but the whipping cream does whip up.

# **What can I add to my whipped hot chocolate?**

- **Pumpkin spice** – Two words: PUMPKIN SPICE! Sprinkle on some pumpkin spice for whipped pumpkin spice hot chocolate, it’s the best fall treat out there.
- **Marshmallows** – Who doesn’t love hot chocolate with marshmallows? Use the marshmallows from Lucky Charms for an even cuter, sweeter treat.
- **Extra cocoa powder** – Dust on some extra cocoa powder for a pretty chocolatey finish.
- **Crushed up oreos** – Whipped Oreo hot chocolate is AMAZING. Crush up some oreos on top.
- **Crushed up cookies** – Don’t stop at oreos, why not try whipped chocolate chip hot chocolate or whipped biscoff hot chocolate.
- **Coffee** – You can even combine whipped hot chocolate with coffee in the milk for a cute lil whipped mocha.
- **Peppermint** – Is it too early for winter? Because whipped peppermint hot chocolate is the dreamiest!

Happy whipping!
