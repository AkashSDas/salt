If you’re looking for a small batch treat to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day, this little chocolate Guinness loaf is for you. It’s rich and deep with just the barest hint of Irish stout and is absolutely perfect on it’s own or along side a pint.

Even though this is technically a post to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day and it has nothing to do with British people, I wanted to mention that I just love the way British people describe sweets. Or food in general. One of my all time favorite things to do in winter is watch Nigella Lawson while I’m doing Christmas baking. She has a whole series of Christmas specials and they always feel that way: special. I think it’s something in the way she talks about food. Everything is luscious and magnificent. Flavors are resonant and gorgeous. It really makes me want to improve my lexicon and branch out from just exclaiming that everything is awesome.

But, speaking of awesome, this little cake definitely is. It’s a Nigella recipe, naturally, and it’s all of the over the top adjectives. I third-ed the recipe and it just about fit in my little loaf pan – you may want to hold back a 1/4 cup batter and make an extra cupcake on the side because my just spilled over the top. It has an awkward egg measurement, but if you have a kitchen scale (if you’re into small batch baking at all, I hope you do!) it’s no big deal to whisk up an egg then measure it out. I truly love using my scale to bake, especially when doing small batch recipes. It just makes the math so much more easy.

Even though I topped the cake with a bit of creme fraiche frosting – it’s supposed to kind of look like a glass of stout – I loved the cake without. And, as Nigella says: it is perfectly acceptable to leave the cake un-iced: in fact, it tastes gorgeous plain.

Happy baking!
