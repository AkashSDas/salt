How’s your pantry looking right now? Are you starting to run low on flour? Luckily Mike snagged a bag of flour at the grocery store right as they were putting it out on the floor so I don’t have any flour anxiety. Still, since there are only two of us here and I definitely don’t need to be eating as many snacks as I have been, I’ve been small batching ALL THE THINGS, hence these brownies.

Are you a fudgy brownie fan or a cakey one? If you like fudgy brownies, these are the brownies for you. Fudgy and moist, this recipe makes just 4 perfectly single serving sized brownies. Or maybe one giant serving if you’re feeling particularly low. They have that signature crinkly thing top that fudgy brownies have so if you’ve been craving a bakery style brownie, this is it!

This is the best small batch recipe with just 2 tablespoons of flour and half an egg. Maybe you’re thinking, “half an egg?!” but really, it’s the best way to small batch things ([more on measuring out half eggs here](https://iamafoodblog.com/how-to-scale-any-recipe-to-make-it-a-small-batch-recipe/)).

**Why You Should Make these Small Batch Brownies**

1. They’re deliciously chocolatey and fudgy.
2. Baking relieves stress and can bring you happiness.
3. You need a treat.
4. They are a very small batch and use a minimum amount of your precious pantry ingredients.
5. Chocolate, enough said.

Let’s get baking! Start off by heating the oven to 350°F. Make sure there’s a rack in the middle of the oven. Lightly butter and line a small loaf pan with parchment paper. I used a small 5.5 inch square pan but a mini loaf pan will work too!

After your pan is ready, set it aside and melt your chocolate over a double boiler. If you don’t have one, just place a heatproof bowl over a small pot that has about an inch of water in it. Place the pot and the bowl with the chopped chocolate, butter, and cocoa over the pot and heat over medium low heat. Stir, until the chocolate melts and the butter and cocoa is totally incorporated. Take off the heat and stir to cool slightly and set aside.

While your chocolate is cooling, mix together the sugars in a medium bowl. Whisk and measure out half an egg, about 1.5 tablespoons, then add it to the sugars. Add the vanilla and mix well.

By now the chocolate mixture should be cool – you don’t want it hot otherwise it’ll cook the eggs – it should be melty and not too warm. Whisk it into the sugar egg mixture a bit at a time until completely incorporated and smooth.

Now it’s time to gently fold in the flour and salt. Use a rubber spatula and gently fold in the flour and a pinch of salt – don’t over mix! You want the flour just incorporated. Pour into your prepared pan, smooth the brownies out then bake. After twenty-ish minutes or so, you can pull out your pan of mini brownies and gaze at them lovingly. I won’t fault you for enjoying them warm, but if you want them to have nice clean cuts, be sure to let them cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

Happy brownie-ing friends! Small batch bakes love!

PS – I topped one of these with [whipped dalgona coffee](https://iamafoodblog.com/how-to-make-fluffy-frothy-whipped-coffee-tips-and-tricks-for-making-dalgona-coffee/), just for fun and it was SO GOOD.
