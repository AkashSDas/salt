# **I love sweets in the morning. Well, actually I love savories first, but after a hearty breakfast, I always feel like it makes sense to finish on something sweet. Something like monkey bread!**

I love those little pull apart squishy balls of chewy, fluffy cinnamon-sugar goodness. If you haven’t had monkey bread before, you’re missing out! Think of it like a cross between a cinnamon bun and pull apart bread. What is it about eating with your hands that is so much more fun that using a knife and fork? Use your hands to really get in there and get those gooey lil cloud-like pillows of sweetness. Monkey bread is a treat best enjoyed warm, with the ones you love.

# **What is monkey bread?**

It has a funny name but it has nothing to do with monkeys or bananas! Monkey bread is a gooey cinnamon sugar pull apart bread that’s baked in a bundt pan. It’s made with soft and squishy pieces of sweet dough dipped in cinnamon and sugar, baked up gooey and sweet.

# **How to make monkey bread**

1. **Make the dough.** Use a stand mixer to do all the hard work. All it takes is a quick knead with a dough hook and you’re good to go.
2. **Let it rest.** After your dough is ready, it’s time for a rest so it can puff up. Now’s a good time to have a cup of coffee or tea.
3. **Roll the dough into balls.** When the dough has doubled in size, it’s time to punch it down and shape it into little balls.
4. **Dip the balls.** After the balls are shaped, dip them in brown butter and a mix of cinnamon and sugar. Pop everything into a buttered bundt pan.
5. **Bake.** Bake until golden, gooey, and delicious.
6. **Drizzle.** Finish off with a drizzle of vanilla icing while it’s still hot so it melts into all the nooks and crannies.
7. **Enjoy!** Eat it while it’s still warm, there’s nothing better, trust me!

# **Monkey bread ingredients**

**Yeast** – this recipe uses active dry yeast which needs to be dissolved in a bit of liquid before using – in this case we’ll sprinkle it on to milk. If you have instant yeast, you can use it too, there won’t be much of a difference; your rolls might rise a bit faster, depending how warm your kitchen is.

**Milk** – I use 2% milk but any milk will work here, even almond or oat milk. Warm the milk up slightly in the microwave (I usually pop it in the microwave in 20 second increments) You want it between 105-115°F, which feels like a warm bath.

**Eggs** – this is a extra rich dough with eggs in it. Not all monkey bread recipes have eggs in them, but this one does. I love the extra flavor and plushness the eggs gives this dough.

**Bread flour** – this one is important. You might be tempted to just use all purpose, and well, you can do that, but if you use bread flour your monkey bread will be soft and fluffy with just the right amount of chew. Bread flour has a higher protein content than regular all purpose – the resulting dough has more gluten in it which helps the little monkey bread balls stay soft and chewy.

**Cinnamon** – fresh cinnamon is best! We’re going to go with a fairly high cinnamon to sugar ratio so each bite is bursting with cinnamon goodness.

**Butter** – I love the way brown butter makes baked goods taste. Browned butter takes this monkey bread over the top!

# **What is brown butter?**

Brown butter, also known as beurre noisette (hazelnut butter in French), is an out of the world delicious concoction originally used in savory French foods but is now used everywhere butter is used. It’s deeply golden, flecked with brown bits, nutty, and incredibly aromatic. Brown butter is perfection.

Browned butter brings so much flavor to baked goods for just a tiny bit of extra effort. It adds a nutty caramel roundness and highlights the cinnamon and sugar in this monkey bread making these soft lil balls so addictive.

# **Do I need a bundt pan for monkey bread?**

If you don’t have a bundt pan, don’t worry, you can still make monkey bread. Just put all the little balls in a a regular pan. It can be round or rectangle, it doesn’t really matter! In fact, I love monkey bread in a loaf pan. [But, if you’re on the lookout for a good bundt, this is the one I have and love.](https://amzn.to/3qXVB27)

Also, pro tip, if you’re wondering when your monkey bread is done – it can be hard to tell with all those little balls – if you have an instant read thermometer, just stick it right into the middle. If it reads 190°F, you’re good to go! If you don’t have an instant read thermometer, use a wooden skewer. You’ll know your monkey bread is done when the top is puffy and crisp and a wooden skewer comes out clean with no crumbs when you poke it into the thickest part.

# **Make ahead**

After the balls are dipped and put into the bundt, wrap the bundt up and put it the fridge right away. The next day, take it out and leave it on the countertop while you heat your oven. Bake as usual and enjoy hot and fresh.

# **How to store**

Monkey bread is best right out of the oven, but if you have leftovers, store them in an air tight container on the countertop for up to three days. Reheat before enjoying.

# **How to reheat**

Take a couple pieces of monkey bread and simply microwave for 10-15 seconds, or until warmed through.
