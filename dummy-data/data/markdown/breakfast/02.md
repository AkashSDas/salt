One of my all time favorite things in Japan is a traditional breakfast – the kind that includes a bowl of rice and miso soup. There’s something so comforting about starting the day with a hearty yet healthy warming meal. You can find these kinds of breakfast sets at lots of different kinds of restaurants in Japan, from the more affordable (Ootoya) to the very luxe.

I think the very first time I really appreciated Japanese style breakfast was when Mike and I went to [Hokkaido](https://iamafoodblog.com/our-hokkaido-adventure/). We stayed at two very different onsen hotels but the thing that they had in common was a buffet style Japanese teishoku breakfast. Typical teishoku (meal set) are: one soup, one side, one main, a side dish, and pickles. At these buffets though, you could choose from infinite sides. It was AMAZING and so fun to go down to breakfast in the provided yukata. Some common dishes they had were: grilled fish, [tamagoyaki](https://iamafoodblog.com/tamagoyaki-sando-japanese-egg-omelet-sandwich-recipe/), [onsen eggs](https://iamafoodblog.com/the-easiest-poached-egg-recipe/), chawan mushi, natto, [tofu](https://iamafoodblog.com/grilled-sweet-savory-miso-glazed-tofutofu-dengaku-recipe/), [gyoza](https://iamafoodblog.com/tokyo-food-guide-search-best-tokyo-gyoza/), [mentaiko](https://iamafoodblog.com/mac-and-kimcheese/), and ton of local vegetables. I had the best time because I love variety!

I wanted to recreate that vibe here at home but also didn’t want to make a huge number of dishes, so I kept it simple with rice, miso soup, grilled fish, tamagoyaki, and pickles. It was so cozy and totally brought me back to the fun we had traveling.

If you’re looking to have a Japanese breakfast in the morning, quickly, you can totally prepare some of the dishes the night before, meal prep style. The tofu and green onions can be cut up the night before and the salmon can be marinated as well. You can even make the tamagoyaki ahead of time if that’s what you need to do. I’m not sure what actual Japanese people do because to be honest, it took quite a bit of time to prepare this. Maybe they are really good at multitasking or maybe teishoku style breakfast is more of a special kind of thing like [the full English](https://iamafoodblog.com/a-breakdown-of-the-full-english-breakfast/). Either way, this was the perfect way to start the day!
