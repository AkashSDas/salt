I’m the worst at eating breakfast. I LOVE breakfast foods but I’m always grumpy in the morning and starting the day by making breakfast just doesn’t seem ideal to me. This is why I like to eat [breakfast foods at dinner](https://iamafoodblog.com/easy-weeknight-bacon-and-egg-stir-fry-lo-mein/). [Or at brunch.](https://iamafoodblog.com/category/sunday-brunch) Preferably after I’ve already had a [coffee or two](https://iamafoodblog.com/mint-mojito-pourover-coffee/). Anyway, not eating breakfast makes me not very fun to be around so in an attempt to be a morning person, I’ve been eating this particular breakfast on repeat.

I start every day the same: soft boiling a jammy egg and cutting up vegetables while Mike makes pour over coffee. The good thing about eating the same breakfast every morning is that you never have to think about it. Part of the reason why I don’t make a variety of breakfasts is because before my brain wakes up I can’t really think or make decisions. I’m pretty indecisive even in the best of times so having my breakfast decision made for me is just about the best thing ever.

**Other pros for eating the same breakfast over and over again:**

- you can prep most of your breakfast the night before
- grocery shopping is as lot easier because you know exactly what you need for breakfast
- according to science, eating the same breakfast everyday could possibly make you happier because you don’t get as much decision fatigue since your very first decision of the day is made for you
- you save time because you’re not waffling (heehee waffles) about what to make for breakfast

I think part of the reason why I’ve been able to eat the same breakfast for the past two weeks straight without getting tired of it is because it’s PRETTY. I mean, it also tastes amazing so there’s that but there’s just something about starting your day with a beautiful and healthy breakfast. I feel like it sets the right tone and makes me feel a just a little bit special. More special than just regular cereal anyway. Not that cereal doesn’t make me feel special because it does – I LOVE cereal.

Back to the yogurt and egg(s). If you make this, and I hope you do, part of the deliciousness lies in how you plate it. Everyone knows that plating is the key to pretty food. To be honest I suck at plating. Mike is the genius food stylist around here. Sometimes I luck out if the food happens to be naturally pretty (like this breakfast is) but if it’s food that’s brown or soupy or just not very good looking, I’m always asking Mike, “um, can you help?”

**If you want to make things look pretty on a plate here are a few good suggestions:**

- make it saucy: sauce makes everything look more appetizing and delicious. Dry food doesn’t appeal that much. Even things that are supposed to be dry and crunchy (like fried chicken or fries) get paired with sauce because humans like sauce. Give us ALL THE SAUCE. In this cause the sauce is the yogurt which is swooshed on in a dramatic fashion.
- stack things: you could put the yogurt on one section of the plate, then the vegetables on another, and the egg on another, but when you stack them all together the dish looks more well thought out and restaurant like. Don’t be inspired by those keep it separate dishes. Stack everything, always.
- garnish: when in doubt, garnish with herbs, spices, or other things. There is a reason why the food at restaurants is pretty. It’s because they all have garnish stations. Garnish is the make up of the food world. Sure you could go out bare-faced, but why? Make it rain garnish.

Anyway that is my very long post on why I like eating yogurt and eggs and how to make them pretty. Thanks for reading LOL.
