I have this daydream where I open up a little french toast cafe that serves up sweet and savory french toasts with coffee and tea. I not-so-secretely have the whole menu planned out. French toast is the ultimate breakfast or anytime meal. It can be classic and super simple, or fancy and seasonal. It’s fast, easy, and it tastes so freaking good.

Crispy golden brown edges with a creamy custard-y center just begging for a drizzle of syrup of a dusting of powdered sugar snow. Gosh, I’m getting hungry just thinking about it.

But as any good day dreamer does, let’s get into the deliciously syrup-ed nooks and crannies of the french toast world.

# **What is french toast?**

French toast is a dish made from sliced bread dipped in eggs and pan fried. It can be both sweet and savory and is one of the oldest ways of reviving old dry bread. Apparently, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_toast), it’s not actually from France. It originated in the Roman Empire in the 4th or 5th century. Who knew!? French toast is popular all over the world – there are infinite french toast variations.

# **How to make french toast**

1. **Make the custard.** In a shallow bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, milk, and a bit of sugar, making sure the eggs are completely incorporated.
2. **Soak the bread.** Take your bread and soak it in the custard mix, flipping once.
3. **Pan-fry.** Add the soaked bread to a hot pan and cook, flipping once, until golden brown and crispy.
4. **Top and enjoy.** Finish it off with butter, syrup, powdered sugar, and fruit and enjoy immediately!

# **Ingredients**

- **Bread.** This is the start of your toast, so use a bread you love! Some people say you need to use stale bread for french toast, but you can use fresh, just don’t soak it as long.
- **Eggs.** This is the next most important ingredient. If you don’t have eggs, you can’t make french toast. The most important thing about the eggs is making sure they’re completely whisked up so there are no bits of egg whites or yolks in the custard.
- **Cream and milk.** We’re going to use a mix of heavy cream and milk to give our toast base a lusciously rich custard texture.
- **Sugar.** Just a touch of sugar to add sweetness and help caramelize the outsides so your toast is crisp and not soggy.

# **The best bread to use**

The absolute best bread for french toast is Japanese milk bread or shokupan. It’s so incredibly fluffy and thick and it soaks up the batter and becomes incredibly creamy and custard-y inside. [You can make your own milk bread](https://iamafoodblog.com/milk-bread/) or buy it from an Asian grocery store. **The next best bread for french toast is thick cut texas toast or brioche.**

# **The secret to really good french toast**

**The secret to the best french toast** is letting it soak longer than you think. You want the bread to be saturated with the custard so that the inside of the bread is creamy and not dry.

**The second secret is** cooking over medium to medium low heat then finishing on medium high. Starting on medium or medium low ensures that the custard-y insides cook all the way through and finishing on medium high gives it a golden brown and crisp caramelized crust.

# **How long you should soak bread**

This depends on how old your bread is, but soaking longer than you think is what will give you a creamy custard middle. Dry french toast is the worst!

- If your bread is fresh: 30 seconds to 1 minute per side
- If your bread is old and dry: 2-5 minutes per side

# **Tips and tricks**

- **Mix well.** Make sure you mix the custard extra well so you don’t have stray pieces of unincorporated egg whites or yolks.
- **Use butter and oil to fry.** Using a combination of butter and oil means you get the best of both worlds: flavor and no burning!
- **Preheat the pan.** Make sure your pan is heated to medium hot before you put your first slice in, it should sizzle slightly.
- **Start on medium heat.** You want to start on medium heat then move to medium high to finish. If you cook on high, you’ll end up cooking the outside of the bread, but the inside will still be soggy and raw.
- **Take your time** with it on medium to medium low heat and aim for a golden brown crust with a creamy, custard-y cooked inside.
