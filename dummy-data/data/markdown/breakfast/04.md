I’m all about fancy Sunday brunches, without the work. I mean, I think everyone is, that’s why going out for brunch is a thing. But, my favorite thing to do, even more than going out for brunch, is making it at home, but only under very specific circumstances.

1. I can’t be hungry because it will lead me to being hangry very quickly.
2. It’s best if everything is kind of sort of already done so all I’m doing is putting things together.

Number one is usually taken care of very easily – I’ll just make sure I pre-brunch with a little snack of cereal or leftovers. Speaking of leftovers, they are the key to number 2. If you have leftovers in the fridge (and I hope you do), you can pretty much brunchifiy anything.

I know the whole “put an egg on it” time is over and done with. I get it – in some circles, eggs are overplayed. No one likes it when people puts eggs on things anymore. Or do they!? Because if you put egg on it, I’m there! And if you have leftovers in the fridge and put an egg on it, you better believe that you can call it brunch.

Which leads us to these breakfast/brunch Yorkshire puddings. I had some leftover yorkies in the fridge. I also had leftover roast beef in the fridge because yorkies and roast beef go hand-in-hand. Of course I put an egg on it and called it brunch.

The End!

PS – If you want some bonus brunch points, sunny side up quail eggs – their tiny cuteness never fails to impress :)

Wishing you a brunch-y Sunday,eggs and things,xoxo steph
