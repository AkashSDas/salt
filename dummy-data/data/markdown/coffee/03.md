Back in university, I was obsessed with coffee cake. I’d grab my books, go to Starbucks, get one of the huge slices of coffee cake, and “study.” Back then I didn’t even really drink coffee, I just always had coffee cake and tea.

It was the one thing that made studying ok, having something to nibble on. Anyway, me and studying are history, but I still love coffee cake with a passion. Especially when it has big ass cinnamon crumbs streaked throughout and on top. Seriously perfect with a cup of coffee.

This recipe is a small batch recipe of course, so you can make it at the beginning of the week and have a tiny slice every day without feeling guilty. Think of it as cake meal prep!

What I love about this cake, aside from the fact that it’s super fast to put together, is that it’s my idea of what a great snack cake it is. Just rich enough, with a tender crumb and almost doughnut-like cinnamon sugar crumbs, I could eat this cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

It’s a standard recipe, but a goodie. Not so fancy unlike some of the hyped pastries that are around lately. What are your guys’ thoughts on hyped food? Are you willing to wait in line to discover for yourself if it’s actually good? I’m a sucker for hype, so I almost always want to try, but then I’m inevitably disappointed. It makes me wonder, how many hyped things are really, truly good?

Hope you’re enjoying spring and that there’s cake in your future!
