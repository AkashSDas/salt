My favourite way to drink coffee is a bastardized version of Vietnamese coffee: espresso with just a touch bit of sweetened condensed milk stirred in. I do love traditional Vietnamese coffee too, with it’s rich, deep flavour and loads of sweetened condensed milk, but in the morning, the speed of the nespresso machine wins over the slow drip, drip of metal filter every time.

The next best way to drink coffee is, of course, with a little something extra stirred in. You could go for Baileys, with it’s mix of whiskey and cream, but since Vietnamese coffee already has condensed milk in it I decided on just a bit of straight whiskey. I call this a recipe, but really, it’s just coffee with a bit of whiskey mixed in.

This tiny tumbler is perfect for Saint Patrick’s Day. I’m not one for green beer, so a lil Vietnamese Irish coffee is just the trick for a bit of festivity. Luck o’the Irish to you! Oh, one last thing, do leprechauns (even the friendly-ish looking Lucky Charms guy) freak you out?! I would definitely be more into St. Patrick’s day if leprechauns weren’t part of the party.
