Do you love boba? You know, those Taiwanese bubble tea drinks with chewy tapioca pearls? I’m Obsessed, capital O. So much so that I feel like I have to restrict myself. It’s truly an addiction. Anyway, I always get the same thing, milk tea with boba/pearls/bubbles because I’m basic. But sometimes, I’ll branch out and get grass jelly or if I’m really feeling wild and they have it, I’ll get coffee jelly.

Coffee jelly is essentially jello/jelly made with coffee. It slurps up nice and easy through the straw and has that delightful texture that you can squish. It’s super refreshing and way cheaper than getting boba out. Heck, you can start your own boba shop with this recipe.

Here I paired it with milk and even more coffee for the ultimate in coffee flavor. But, I’ll have you know, I did it all with decaf! Of course, you go caffeinated if you like, you do you!
