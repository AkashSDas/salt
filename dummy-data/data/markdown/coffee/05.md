Guys, I have a new obsession: mint mojito coffee! It sounds kind of weird, but really, it’s all kinds of wonderful. Think, milky, minty, sweet iced coffee. Mike and I discovered it on our latest trip in LA. We were staying in a building right next to an orange coffee shop named [Philz](http://www.philzcoffee.com/). It looked pretty popular; there were always people walking in and out with their cups, but for some reason it didn’t call to me. It was probably the fact that the lobby of our building had free, albeit not that great, coffee for the taking.

Anyway, on the last day of our stay, I decided to look up Philz to see what the buzz was about. Everyone on the internets was going crazy over their [mint mojito coffee](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEwVYkvjIRI/?taken-by=iamafoodblogeats). It sounded weird to me, but I thought I’d be adventurous and go with it. The barista was crazy nice and in the end, when I took my first sip, I was so pleasantly surprised! I even made Mike take a sip – he does not do things in his coffee, he’s a straight up black espresso or pour over kinda guy – and he ended up liking it too!

Seriously, that cup of coffee haunted me the whole time we drove up the coast. So much so that I sweetly asked Mike if we could make a quick detour into SF to grab a large mint mojito. I even contemplated getting two so I could have an extra one in the car. I didn’t end up getting two, but we did stop to grab a [Rebel Within muffin from Craftsman and Wolves](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFDYW0pmVy_/?taken-by=theles__), which, like the Philz coffee, I am going to try to recreate.

Anyway, haunting road trip snacks aside, this mint mojito coffee needs to happen in your life! At its core, it’s just coffee, mint, sugar, and ice. But really, it’s so much more. Mike’s even been having them, sans milk, it’s that life changing. We have three large bunches of mint in the fridge, just waiting to be muddled with sugar for coffee. Please excuse me while I make another cup…

PS – Mike took these photos, aren’t they gorgeous?!
