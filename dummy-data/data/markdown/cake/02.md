**I love all mini things, especially mini food like these cereal pancakes.**

I’ve had a thing for mini pancakes for a while (see these [mini strawberry shortcake cuties](https://iamafoodblog.com/strawberry-shortcake-strawberry-pancakes-recipe/)), so when I started seeing a huge amount of pancake cereal TikToks, I knew I had to make some! Trust me when I say that pancakes taste better when they’re mini. 10/10 would recommend.

# What are cereal pancakes?

Pancake cereal is just pancakes, but mini, so they’re cereal sized! Imagine tiny, tiny freshly cooked pancakes in a bowl and there you have it: pancake cereal!

# How do you eat pancake cereal?

To fork or not to fork…I’ve seen people use a fork to poke the pancakes essentially making mini stacks of pancakes and I’ve also seen people using a spoon. I think how you eat them is up to you. I’ve tried them both ways and I think it depends on how big you make your mini pancakes. Obviously if your pancake are really teeny you won’t be able to use a fork. Go with your gut and just do you.

# Milk or No Milk?

This one is up to you too! I like my pancake cereal with just butter and syrup, but if you’re a milk lover, by all means, pour some milk on there. Just don’t be all crazy and put the milk in the bowl first, mmmkay?

# What equipment do you need to make pancake cereal?

You just need a regular bowl, a non-stick frying pan (very important when making pancakes), a squeeze bottle or ziplock bag with the tip cut off, a spatula (or a pair of chopsticks) to flip, and a bowl to eat out of.

Side note: I like using [an electric crepe maker](https://amzn.to/2VWVVkl) because it’s the absolute best at keeping the heat at the proper temperature – I use it whenever I make pancakes.

# How to make pancake cereal

1. **Make your pancake batter.** I like to use my favorite pancake recipe because it’s the perfect consistency for piping out into pancake cereal, not too thick and not too thin. My recipe makes enough for one big bowl of cereal or two smaller ones and is perfect because it doesn’t use up too much flour or butter. You can use my favorite recipe (see below), your go to pancake recipe, or boxed pancake mix. Whatever you end up doing, make sure the pancake batter is not too thick and not to thin or runny. If the batter is too thin all the pancakes will run into each other.If it’s too thick you won’t be able to pipe it out. Make sure it’s not too lumpy either or it won’t pipe out smoothly.
2. **Once your pancake batter is mixed up** and the right consistency, put it into a squeeze bottle with a small opening OR put it in a ziplock bag. Don’t cut off the tip of the ziplock bag until you’re ready to cook. Also, it’s better to make the cut on the bag pretty tiny. If the hole is too big, your pancakes will also end up pretty big.
3. **When your batter is ready,** heat up a non-stick pan over medium-low heat. Brush a thin layer of oil on your pan. Pipe out small pancakes or drop the batter by the 1/4 teaspoon and cook until small bubbles form on the surface and at the edges. Flip and continue cooking until golden brown, about 30 seconds more.

# Strawberry Shortcake Cereal Pancakes

These are the perfect summer cereal pancake: super mini vanilla cereal pancakes with juicy strawberries and soft whipped cream. Fork it or spoon it, either way these are the DREAM summer breakfast or brunch.

# How to make strawberry shortcake cereal pancakes

1. **Pick the smallest strawberries** at the store or farmer’s market – the smaller the berry, the sweeter.
2. **Wash and hull the berries,** then cut them in halves or quarters. Sprinkle them with a bit of sugar and a tiny pinch of salt so the berries macerate and get super juicy.
3. **Make some softly whipped cream** by pouring 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream into a chilled bowl with 1 tablespoon sugar. Whisk until soft peaks form (use an electric whisk if you have it!) then keep cold in the fridge.
4. **While the berries are getting juicy,** make the pancakes as per the recipe below.
5. **Place the pancakes on a plate** or bowl and top with the whipped cream and strawberries spooned on top. Enjoy!

# Pancake Cereal Tips and Tricks

- Use oil instead of butter for the pan. Butter has a low heat point so it’s better to use oil if you don’t want your pancakes to end up burnt-looking.
- Keep the pan on low heat to start and then turn up the heat once you’ve piped out all the pancakes. Or, if you’re really slow, you can heat the pan, then turn it off, pipe out the pancakes, then turn the stove on after you’re done to cook them.
- Pipe the pancakes out smaller than you think – they will spread a tiny bit. If you want extra mini pancakes, your pancake batter should just be smaller than the size of a dime.
- If you’re not particular, use a giant flipper to flip all your pancakes at once. Or, use a pair of chopsticks to flip over each pancake individually. You can even just shake and toss the pan.
- If you want your pancakes to be warm, keep them warm in the oven. Because they’re so tiny, they don’t stay warm for very long. If you want warm pancakes, keep them warm in a low oven.
