Hello Oreo cheesecake! If you’re firmly in the no bake cheesecake camp, this no bake Oreo cheesecake is just the thing for you. They’re creamy, chocolatey, and just plain good. If you love cookies and cream, you’ll love these bars.￼ I love them so much that I always quarter the recipe so it only makes four bars. Even so,￼￼ I think I ate the whole batch in just under two days, which kind of defeats the purpose, but it is what it is.

Do you love Oreos? Cookies and cream ice cream is one of my favorites! I like the way the black and white cookies mixed into ice cream and as a kid I would always get cookies and cream blizzards at Dairy Queen.

I am obsessed with Oreos. We even buy the weird flavors, just so I can try them (I love it when the pumpkin spice ones come out!). Mike’s more of a classic Oreo guy, but I love all the seasonal varieties.￼ Anyway, we’ve gone through several bags of Oreos during the pandemic. I kept saying that I wanted to make no bake Oreo cheesecake and earmarked￼ cookies just for that purpose, but always ended up eating them all straight out of the package.￼

Sidenote￼, isn’t it weird that one of America’s most popular cookies is not really makeable at home? I mean [I did try to make Oreos once](https://iamafoodblog.com/corgios-aka-corgi-oreos/) but they didn’t really turn out the same.￼ It’s a good thing that Oreos lend themselves so well to being made into other baked goods. I love watching TikToks with deep fried Oreos, Oreo mug cakes, and [Oreo donuts](https://iamafoodblog.com/panda-donuts/).

# **What is no bake cheesecake?**

No bake cheesecake is a unbaked cheesecake. Instead, it sets by using either gelatin, or in this case, whipping cream. It’s perfect because you don’t have to turn on your oven and it’s really easy to make. This oreo cheesecake is super simple with a base of cream cheese and heavy whipping cream. You set it in the freezer and it settles into a creamy kind of ice cream texture. I love it frozen, but you can defrost it in the fridge and it tastes just like regular cheesecake.￼￼

# **How to make no bake Oreo cheesecake**

It’s really simple: crush up some Oreos and mix with melted butter for the base of the cheesecake. The cheesecake itself is whipped room temperature cream cheese, heavy cream, sugar, and crushed Oreos￼. That’s it! The most time you spend on this is waiting for the cheesecake to set. Quick and easy and perfect for quarantine “baking.”
