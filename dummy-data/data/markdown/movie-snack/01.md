I’m a snack monster and while on keto, there aren’t really that many snacks you can have. I’m used to reaching for a bag of chips or maybe if I’m feeling particularly healthy, some fruit. Both fruit and chips are a big NO on the keto diet so I had to find myself some snacks that were low carb and keto friendly because me without snacks just isn’t me at all.

So, if you’re looking for some low-carb, keto friendly snacks, I’ve got your back. These are they things I look for in a snack: crunchy, satisfying, and mindless. The last one is hard because you can’t really mindlessly snack, but the 9 snacks I’m listing here are my absolute favorite because, well, they’re snacks, some of them are crunchy, and all of them are satisfying. Sometimes so satisfying that I eat more than I should. Oops!

**Whisps/Parm Crisps**This are my go-to when I’m looking for the satisfying crunch of a chip. They’re crispy, they’re crunchy, and the best part is they’re made of just cheese! You know that delicious thing that happens when lasagna bakes and there are crispy crunchy, cheesy edges? Or maybe when cheese falls out of your grilled cheese? That stuff is frico cheese: what happens to cheese when it melts then caramelizes into a crispy-crunchy lacy cracker. Whisps/Parm Crisps are those cheesy one ingredient crackers. You can definitely make them at home easily, but I like having a bag (or six) in the cupboard for when I need that chip like snack. My favorite flavors are the [sesame parm crisps for the nuttiness](https://amzn.to/2LADaN8) and the [asiago and pepper jack cheese for the spice](https://amzn.to/2ZKKzm5). [The original ones are good too](https://amzn.to/34xjC5h](https://amzn.to/34xjC5h). The best part is that they’re 0 grams of carbs!

**Macros per serving: they vary per flavor, but they’re about 100 calories, 7 grams fat, and 0 carbs.**

**[Crispy Seaweed](https://amzn.to/2N1vp66)**Okay, this stuff is my kryptonite. I mean, I love regular seaweed snacks too but these are seaweed snacks on another level. If you love nori/seaweed, you will love these snacks, trust me. They’re like a [seaweed chip](https://amzn.to/2N1vp66). They have more heft and crunch compared to regular seaweed and they are just so crisp and light and addictive. I’ve loved this brand of crispy seaweed even before I started keto so I was so happy when I discovered that they are only 1 gram of net carbs per serving. That means if you eat the whole bag, like I do, almost every time, it’s only 2 grams for the whole thing! If you’re using CarbManager to enter your macros, be sure to make a custom entry because when I scan the bar code in, it’s wrong. I don’t think I can live without these. They are other flavors, but I stick to [the original](https://amzn.to/2N1vp66) because some of the other ones have sugar in them.

**Edamame/[Dry Roasted Edamame](https://amzn.to/2LBSGsp)**I love edamame and it’s one of the few appetizers that you can still have if you’re going out with friends for sushi so it’s the perfect combination of sexy and cute. Low carb and tasty, especially if you season them with a little bit of your favorite spice blend. I like to keep it simple with salt and pepper but I have been know to spice it up with Japanese shichimi togarashi/seven spice. It adds that extra bit of flavor that you need sometimes. I also really like [roasted edamame](https://amzn.to/2LBSGsp). They’re super crunchy and a bit dry so if you don’t like dry or crunchy they might not be for you, but they’re just as satisfying as nuts to me, probably because of the salt, but lower calories so I love them.

**Macros per serving for edamame: 100 calories, 4 grams fat, 3 grams net carbsMacros per serving for dry roasted edamame: 65 calories, 2 grams fat, 2 grams net carbs**

**[Macadamia Nuts](https://amzn.to/2LyCEiN)**I’ve loved mac nuts since forever: they’re buttery, crunchy, and oh so satisfying. They also happen to be the lowest carb of all the nuts (along with Brazil nuts). If you’re an it lover and nuts are one of your go-to snacks, you should definitely be switching to macadamia nuts. Almonds, cashews, and pistachios are actually high in carbs, so just buy [a big bag of mac nuts at Costco](https://amzn.to/2LyCEiN) and go to town. Pecans are fairly low in carbs too, but I don’t find them as satisfying as macadamias. As a bonus, macadamias are pretty high in fat too, which makes it the perfect keto nut.

**Cheese of all Kinds**There are so many kinds of cheeses in the world and I love them all – with the exception of very blue cheese. And now, with the whole low-carb trend, all of the cheese companies are putting out individual snack sizes of cheese. There’s more than just cheese sticks and cheese strings out there friends! Although I do love a good cheese stick. My favorites are: baby brie, bite-sized fresh mozzarella balls, marble cheddar sticks, and low moisture mozzarella balls. I love that I can have a mini cheese plate made up of ALL THE CHEESE. Sometimes I add a few macadamias and the combo of salty and creamy is the perfect snack. Pro tip: always check the nutritional info on cheese because some of them have carbs in them. I always buy the ones that have a less than 1 gram or 0 grams of carbs.

**Macros per serving: they vary per cheese, but they’re usually about 100 calories, 5-8 grams of fat, and 0 carbs**

**Fry Your Own Cheese Crisps**Yep, I know I already mentioned store-bought cheese crips, but there’s something about making your own cheese crisps, when you have time that is so much better. First off, they are kind of warm, which makes them just a little more cozy. Second, if you’re feeling extra, you can make them into little taco shapes and use them to hold things. No matter how you eat them, they’re a good thing. All you need to do is cut up some cheese into small pieces and heat them in a non-stick pan over medium-low heat until the cheese melts and starts to bubble. When the cheese is crispy looking, remove the pan from the heat, let cool slightly, then enjoy. Warm and cheesy and good like picking off the cheesy bits from your favorite cheesy baked casserole.

**Jammy Eggs with Scallion Oil**This probably isn’t the most quick snack, unless you have a batch of [scallion oil](https://iamafoodblog.com/ginger-scallion-sauce-the-green-sauce-youre-going-to-want-to-put-on-everything/) in the fridge (it’s a very delicious way to add fat to your keto diet) but it’s very savory and extremely satisfying. Just make some jammy eggs (6 and a half minutes), peel them, cut them in half, and top each side with 1/2 tablespoon of scallion oil. You get protein and fat making them a cute little keto bite.

**Quick Deviled Eggs with [Everything Bagel Spice](https://amzn.to/34v2UTR)**I love [everything bagel spice](https://amzn.to/34v2UTR) because, well, it makes things taste like bagels. Not really, who are we kidding, but it actually is a nice savory spice blend that adds a huge hit of flavor without any pesky carbs. I like to hard boil an egg, mash up the yolk with 1 tablespoon of kewpie mayo, scoop it back into the whites and sprinkle generously with everything bagel spice. I could make a meal out of these and to be honest, I have.

**Cheesy Egg Taco**This is probably my most favorite way of eating cheese and eggs together. I got the idea from @julesfood over on instagram. You can hold your cheesy egg up like a taco and it’s crispy, gooey, and so GOOD. I don’t make them that often because when I do I feel like I immediately want to make another but really, the macros on this snack are amazing so I should just make them two at a time. This is how you do it: heat up 1/2 tablespoon butter in a small non-stick pan. Evenly sprinkle on 1/4 cup grated cheese and let it melt. When melty, add the egg and cook until the egg is done to your liking. Turn up the heat at the end for a bit so the cheese gets crispy, then remove the heat from the pan and let the cheese solidify a bit. Slide out of the pan and enjoy!
