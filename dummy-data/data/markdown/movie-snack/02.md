**These oatmeal strawberry muffins are the perfect combination of healthy and sweet treat.** A hearty, healthy(ish) oatmeal muffin studded with sweet strawberries.

Spring is in the air. The cherry blossoms are starting to bloom and the sunshine is starting to give me serious serotonin. Whenever the weather turns warm, I think about long walks, picnics, and chill vibes hikes. And when I think about hikes, I think about hiking snacks, like these muffins!

They’re topped with a sprinkle of [crunchy sanding sugar](https://amzn.to/3vm3G2Z) and have a hefty amount of protein rich, keep-you-full, rolled oats. I love the combination of juicy, jammy strawberries with the nuttiness of oats.

# **Why make strawberry oatmeal muffins**

Muffins are my favorite because they’re kind of like granola bars, but better. They’re portable, they fill you up, and they taste good too. What more could you want?

This recipe is a riff off of [my favorite blueberry muffin recipe](https://iamafoodblog.com/jordan-marshs-blueberry-muffins-recipe/) but with strawberries instead of blueberries and the added whole grain nuttiness of rolled oats. It’s the perfect springtime muffin – reminding me of warmer days ahead filled with summer strawberries.

# **How to make oatmeal muffins**

1. **Soak.** Soak the oats in a bit of milk to soften and thicken.
2. **Cream.** Cream butter and sugar together until fluffy, then stir in an egg, vanilla, and the oat-milk mixture.
3. **Stir.** Add flour, baking powder, and salt to the creamed mix, stirring until just combined.
4. **Mix.** Mix in the strawberries and spoon out the batter into a muffin tin. Top with a sprinkle of rolled oats.
5. **Bake.** Bake, let cool, and enjoy!

# **Oatmeal muffin ingredients**

These oatmeal muffins have all your classic ingredients: butter, milk, sugar, eggs, vanilla, flour, baking powder and salt. Essentially the only thing we’re doing a bit differently is adding oats.

**Old fashioned rolled oats**, sometimes just called rolled oats, are what we’re going to use in these muffins. We’re going to soak them in milk to activate their thickening power and give them a chance to rehydrate before adding to the muffin batter so the oats bake up lighter and fluffier.

# **Oatmeal muffin variations**

You can customize these muffins with any fruit you like! Substitute raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, cherries, even shredded carrots or zucchini. To add some chocolate goodness, stir in 1/2-3/4 cup chopped chocolate or chocolate chips when you add the fruit.
