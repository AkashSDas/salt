Oreos are the perfect store bought cookie. You can do so many things with them. You can dunk them, make mug cakes with them, and even make oreo sushi. Yup, you read that right, oreo sushi!

Why eat oreos the regular way when you can sushi-fy them!? Some of you might think that Japanese people would think that oreo sushi would be a travesty, but I assure you, Japanese people are totally down for innovation! Besides, obviously these oreo sushi are not really sushi. They are a sweet and fun oreo dessert shaped into little sushi rolls. It’s bussin as the kids say!

I love oreos. In fact, we almost always have some in the pantry. Right now they’re oreo thins but I pretty much like all the oreos, even the wacky flavored ones like cinnamon bun and carrot cake. There’s just something incredibly nostalgic about the taste of oreos. They make me feel like everything is right with the world. This is not sponsored by the way. I just love oreos. Whenever I see a new oreo trend, I gotta try it. These lil oreo rolls are super cute and really easy to make.

# What is oreo sushi?

Oreo sushi is made from oreos, crushed up and re-shaped into sushi rolls. Basically, you take oreos, separate them, crush the cookies, then mix them with milk to create a dough. The dough is rolled out, then spread with oreo cream. Roll everything up and slice it, like a sushi roll. Oreo sushi comes to us via Tiktok and it looks like [@mariahortiz20](https://www.tiktok.com/@mariahortiz20/video/6944796363204955397) was the one who popularized it.

# How to make oreo sushi

1. **Separate the cookies.** Twist the cookies and scrape off the cream into a bowl. Repeat until all of the cookies and cream are separated.
2. **Crush the cookies.** Pop the chocolate cookies into a food processor and pulse until the cookies turn into a fine crumb.
3. **Make the dough.** Add 3 tbsp milk to the cookies and pulse until everything comes together in a dough.
4. **Roll out the dough.** On a piece of plastic wrap, shape the dough into a rough rectangle with your hands. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out evenly. Trim the edges so they’re straight.
5. **Mix the cream.** Mix the cream with 2 tsp of milk, until smooth and creamy.Spread the cream. Evenly spread the cream onto the cookie base.
6. **Roll.** Roll up the cookie tightly around the cream, using the plastic wrap to help you. If you have time, wrap the roll up in plastic wrap and let it set in the fridge for a while.
7. **Slice.** Use a sharp knife and slice through the roll to make cute lil sushi rounds and enjoy!

# Ingredients

- **Oreos** – I went with standard oreos because they have the perfect cream to cookie ratio.
- **Milk** – You can use any kind of milk you like, non-dairy included. If you use a vegan milk, these oreo sushi end up being vegan because oreos are naturally vegan!

# FAQ

# How do I make perfectly round rolls?

When you’re rolling up the sushi, roll it slowly, evenly, and tightly across the entire roll, using the plastic wrap to help guide you. For extra clean rounds, wrap up the roll in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for a couple of minutes for it to firm up before slicing. When you slice, use a slicing motion instead of just pushing down on the knife.

# Why is my oreo sushi squished?

It’s possible that your oreo base got too warm or you added too much milk to the oreos when you were making the oreo dough. Try putting the rolled up sushi in the fridge to firm it up a bit before slicing.

# My oreo dough keeps falling apart

This is probably because you don’t have enough milk in your oreo cookies. Add a tiny bit more, a teaspoon at a time until the oreo dough can be squished into a ball and hold its shape.

# Do I have to use oreos?

You can use any cream sandwich cookie! You can even make this with other flavored oreos, not just the classic.

# Do I need a food processor?

It’s easiest to make this with a food processor because the food processor can break down the oreo cookies into a fine crumb which makes it easier to come together in a dough. It also helps with mixing the milk into the oreo cookies. [We have this one](https://amzn.to/3wbk7iz), it was not too expensive and it’s lasted us a long time!

# How can I crush oreos without a food processor?

If you don’t have a food processor, take your oreo cookies and place them in a ziplock bag and crush the cookies, as much as you can, until they turn into fine crumbs. You can use a rolling pin to crush and roll over them.

# I don’t have a rolling pin, how do I make oreo sushi?

If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a bottle or something with straight sides to roll out the dough. It might not be as pretty, but it will definitely work!

# How do I spread the cream evenly?

My all time favorite too for spreading things evenly is an [offset spatula](https://amzn.to/2RyV3TC)! You can also place a piece of plastic wrap on top of the cream and use a rolling pin to roll it out gently.
