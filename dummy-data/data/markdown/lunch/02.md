There are two types of people in the world: stuffing lovers and stuffing haters. The people who are indifferent to stuffing don’t matter – are they even really people?! Then there are people who call stuffing “dressing” or are dead serious about whether or not it should go inside the turkey. Here’s where I stand: loud and proud stuffing lover, it’s definitely stuffing not dressing, and it should never ever be made inside the bird. There you have it, *fight me*.

I am true stuffing lover. I feel like I can make a meal out of stuffing and I’m kind of not proud to admit it, but the other day I had a lunch of, you got it, stuffing and only stuffing. As much as I love it, I hardly every make it. It’s definitely a fall/winter holiday food for me. That being said, I’m pretty sure that you guys get it when I say that no turkey dinner is complete without stuffing. In an effort to streamline stuffing, I did it all in the Instant Pot.

You might be wondering why bother making stuffing in an Instant Pot when you can bake it right in your oven. Well, the truth is, our oven is **tiny**. I’m talking about you can only bake about 4 cookies at a time tiny. I think if I was okay with using two racks we might be able to get away with 8 cookies, but trust me, it’s a little apartment sized oven and if there’s other stuff in it (heehee) then the stuffing gets demoted.

This is where the Instant Pot comes in handy. I used the insert to sear the mushrooms and cook the onions, mixed everything up, then popped it all into a little pan for easy removal and prettiness at the table. It was easy as stuffing!
