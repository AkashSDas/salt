Give me ALL the pizza toasts! Was there any after-school snack that was better than pizza toast? Wait, don’t answer that because asking me to choose between after-school snacks is just too cruel – they’re all so good. But, pizza toast holds a special spot in my heart because it was one of my small repertoire of recipes that I could make on my own, at seven years old. Other recipes included: regular toast, butter and sugar toast, instant noodles, and scrambled eggs.

Hmm…my recipe list wasn’t very long! But, even though I can make way more things now, sometimes I just want to go back to the wholesome feeling of being a kid again. Hence: pizza toast! It’s been a long time since I’ve had pizza that wasn’t proper pizza and after biting into these guys, fresh out of the oven, both Mike and I smiled. They tasted just like childhood.

We had a bunch of fun coming up with combos and taste testing them against each other. Mike was all about the deluxe and I was all about the ham and pineapple. Speaking of pineapple, are you for or against it? I don’t know why people hate on pineapple on pizza. Remember that whole internet debate about it? The Icelandic president said he wanted to [ban pineapple on pizza](https://www.google.ca/search?q=iceland+president+pineapple+pizza&oq=iceland+pres&aqs=chrome.3.0j69i57j0l4.3499j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). And then Gordon Ramsey said that [pineapple doesn’t belong on pizza](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gordon-ramsey-pineapple-pizza_us_58dee249e4b0c777f78797aa)?! I LOVE pineapple on pizza! For the record, Mike does too, one of his favorite combos is pepperoni and pineapple. How could you not love the sweet-tartness, balance, and complexity pineapples add? What about you guys? Are pro-pineapple?

Anyway, debate aside, happy pizza toasting!
