The weather has been sunny and gorgeous and it’s giving me all the fall feels. Mike and I bought some decorative gourds (because it’s [motherfucking decorative gourd season](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/its-decorative-gourd-season-motherfuckers)! Click the link, it’s hilarious >\_<)  and a fall themed bouquet to fall-ifize the house and it’s really adding to the ambience around here. You know, you gotta have fall things, even if you’re just sitting around, binge watching Netflix while eating cold pizza.

In other news, I also [baked my first challah](https://www.instagram.com/p/BK1YEMYgINf/?taken-by=iamafoodblog)! Since I’m a challah baking virgin, I texted someone who’s been around the block and back with challah: Molly, of [My Name is Yeh](http://www.mynameisyeh.com/). After some dubiously wet dough (ugh, wet dough) I held my breath, braided, proofed, then sacrificed my loaf to the heat of the oven. Molly said I nailed it, so I think me and challah are going to be new BFFs.

You know who else is one of my new BFFs? Molly’s new book, [Molly on the Range](http://amzn.to/2diPC1x). So far, I’ve made: some seriously good fried rice, her cult classic funfetti cake, and these tasty-cute slider cakes! Next up, is her scallion challah, because (c)hallah, I’m on a roll. Like a bread roll, get it?!

Seriously though, if you like food, farms, or fun, you need [this book](http://amzn.to/2diPC1x) in your life. It’s full of well-written quirky cute essays, gorgeous photos, and recipes that I want to make and eat immediately, like these little cakes. I knew that I’d make the slider cakes, because a.) they’re mini and I’m obsessed with mini and b.) well, does there even need to be b?

These guys whipped up fast and easy and taste like boxed cake mix, but ten thousand times better. I have a thing for boxed cake mix but hardly ever buy it, just because I feel like I’d lose what little-to-no street cred I have as a baker. But now, I can just whip up this recipe, which is perfect, even if you don’t make them into cute little happy meals.
