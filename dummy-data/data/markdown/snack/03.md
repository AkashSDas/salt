It’s Mother’s Day! Are you doing anything special? My brother and sister-in-law are having a barbecue and I’m bringing over a lasagna. When I told my mom, she said, “Yummy, haven’t had that in a long time!” I can’t wait, both because I haven’t seen my mom in a while and because I too haven’t had lasagna in a while.

Lasagna is definitely something my mom would make me and my brother all the time when we were little. She’d make a big pan and we’d eat through it as after school snacks. My mom was seriously the best. But of course, she was a mom too, which meant that she sometimes made me eat things that I didn’t like eating either, like [the outsides of egg tarts](https://www.instagram.com/p/n3Udn-M2Tj/?taken-by=iamafoodblog).

We’d always order egg tarts at dim sum and I want to just eat the custardy insides and leave the outsides behind. Sometimes my mom would indulge me and eat the crusts for me (true love) but more often than not it was a you get what you get and you don’t get upset kind of deal.

Now that I’m a grown up I don’t mind the outsides of egg tarts as much. Especially when they’re Portuguese egg tarts, which are decidedly different than regular Chinese egg tarts. The tart part of Portuguese egg tarts is thin, layered, flaky, and when good, incredibly crisp, offering a nice foil to the soft custardy insides. If you haven’t heard of Portuguese egg tarts before, Mandy has some insight into the whole [tart-controversy](http://ladyandpups.com/2016/02/24/zero-folding-pastel-de-nata-a-hybrid/).

See, the thing is, there is such as thing as real [Portuguese egg tarts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel_de_nata), made in Portugal, as well as Portuguese style egg tarts which have been popularized in Hong Kong, and, as a result, other Asian communities across the world. From what I can tell, the Asian-ized Portuguese tarts are more like egg tarts, with an flan-like egg tart filling in a Portuguese shell, with some brûlée-ing on top.

I haven’t had real Portuguese egg tarts, in Portugal, but I have had some in London, and the filling is completely different – it’s more thick and solid, kind of like the filling in a custard pie. Regardless of the differences in fillings, the similarity is that all of the Portuguese tarts that I’ve seen, authentic or not, have a blackened, brûléed top.

I took it a step further from the original here by flavoring the custard with matcha because, well, I love matcha. The result: thin and shatteringly crisp shells with a creamy, intensely matcha flavored custard. They may not be the prettiest tarts out there, but like my mom always, taught me, it’s not how you look, it’s how you taste. Wait, I think it was something more along the lines of, it’s what’s on the inside that counts. ;)

Happy Mother’s day Mom! And happy mother’s day too all the moms out there :)
