This is the perfect cozy, hearty, yet light, meal. Oodles of noodles, ALL the veggies, tofu, and a spicy savory broth. I love [Korean army stew](https://iamafoodblog.com/budae-jjigae-korean-army-stew-recipe/) and this vegetarian version is SO GOOD. This is essentially a vegetarian budae jjigae recipe: lots and lots of tofu, vegetables, a super spicy red hot broth, and noodles, because noodles. It comes together so quickly and easily and I love how it’s essentially a clean out the fridge kind of meal.

We ate this yesterday during a binge watch of Jeopardy. I don’t know if you guys watch Jeopardy, but Mike and I are fans. I used to watch it when I was a wee girl and when I found out that Mike was into Jeopardy too…swoon. Anyway, they just did this crazy thing: an all star battle where all the top Jeopardy winners came back to compete in teams in a bracket competition. It was WILD my friends. I’m such a nerd, I know, but it was so fun to chat with Mike about who we thought would win, what the odds were, how they would play the game, and of course, compete on who knew the most answers. So fun.

Even more fun because we had tofu and vegetables and noodles while we were watching – it was so spicy and warming. This recipe couldn’t be any easier: throw everything into a pot. Add stock (or water) then add the seasoning mix. Bring to a simmer and boom, deliciousness.

Oh my gosh. Just heard the news about Alex Trebek. I have no words :( I hope he will be okay.
