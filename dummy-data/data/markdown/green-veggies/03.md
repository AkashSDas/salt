- [The best baked potatoes.](https://iamafoodblog.com/baked-potato/) Who says baked potatoes aren’t a meal? If you’ve had an excellent baked potato, you know, it’s even better than steak! Crispy, salty skins, fluffy insides, and piping hot so the butter melts right in to all the nooks and crannies. My favorite topping is broccoli and cheese :)

Roast some up and serve them with pickled shallots, honey roasted walnuts, and a cooling cucumber yogurt sauce.
