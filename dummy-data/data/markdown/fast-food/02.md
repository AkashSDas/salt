I can eat nachos all the time, anytime, but there’s something especially satisfying about eating them for breakfast. These guys are topped off with crispy spicy pork chorizo, soft scrambled eggs, tomatoes, onions, and as much cheese as you can handle.

The key to excellent nachos is layering instead of having a giant mountain of chips topped off with cheese. To achieve the perfect nacho layers, lay down a thin bed of tortilla chips, sprinkle on toppings, then do another thin layer of chips and toppings. Think of it like making a lasagna, that way you’ll never suffer a naked chip again.

Happy breakfast nacho-ing!
