So you are a barista? Perfect. This carton of Barista Edition oat drink is made from liquid oats, which means it isn’t overly sweet or excessively heavy. What it is is fully foamable, putting you in total control over the density and performance of your foam so you can showcase your latte art skillz — sorry, we mean skills. Anyway, give it a try and see what you think. We are here for you from now on, whenever you are ready. So you are a non-barista? Also perfect. Just heat this Barista Edition Oat Drink in a container while giving it a whirl until it foams up nicely and then pour yourself a latte without milk. And if you don’t feel like a latte, you will be happy to know that this product tastes just as amazing if you drink it straight or pour it on your granola or put it to work with your cooking skills. But let’s keep that between us non-baristas, okay?
