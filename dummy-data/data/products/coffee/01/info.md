## What’s Amazing

---

This is our super premium product that tastes amazing without doing a thing to it, but performs technically beautifully when foamed. Or if you are the kind of person who likes to add a splash of milk to your deep dark brew, this product can handle that as well without wimping out and separating. Any tea drinkers in the house? You probably won’t want to turn your tea into a foam party but don’t want any separation either. You are good from now on. The secret to this product? It’s rich in unsaturated fat and if you want to know what that means read the \* below.

- Barista Edition oat drink is rich in unsaturated fat. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats in your daily diet contributes to maintaining a recommended cholesterol level.

## What Might Be Less Amazing

In order to make this product perform to the professional expectations of baristas, we have used an acidity regulator. But one thing you can be sure of is that there is nothing in this product that isn’t absolutely necessary or absolutely approved for consumption. Everything is plant-based, sustainable, and void of stupid GMOs.

## Last But Not Least

- Barista Edition for the pros.
- Barista Edition for the non-pros too.
- Foamable, no, make that micro-foamable.
- Secret: warm it, foam it and drink it straight. Trust me.
